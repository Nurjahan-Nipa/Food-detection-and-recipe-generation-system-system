# CookVision: A Virtual AI-Powered Cooking Assistant for ingredient Detection and Recipe Gudiance Using Machine Learning

## üîç Abstract
**CookVision** is a virtual prototype of an AI-powered cooking assistant that uses machine learning and image detection to support the food preparation process. The system simulates a smart kitchen environment by using pre-recorded images and videos to detect ingredients, cooking tools, and food states. It integrates a pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv8) with a rule-based recipe recommendation engine to suggest context-aware recipts based on detected inputs.

The system is designed and tested entirely in a virtual space, enabling team members to develop and evaluate the core functionalities without physical hardware. A simple web-based interface displays detection results and guides users through recipe steps. This prototype serves as a foundation for future deployment on edge devices, demostrating the feasibility of combining computer vision and machine learning in the domain of intelligent cooking assistant.

## Dataset to be used
### Food Image Detection
Image to help train or test the object detection system (e.g, identifying tomatoes, onions, etc.):
- [Food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101/data)
- [UECFOOD-256](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkuo2000/uecfood256)
- YOLOV8 (Optionally train our model ourselves as needed)

### Cooking Activity & Steps Detection
- [EPIC-KITCHENS Dataset](https://github.com/epic-kitchens)
- [YouCook2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/morpheushoc/youcook2)

### Recipe and Ingredient Matching.
- [Kaggle's Recipe Ingredients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset)
- Create our own clean, curated dataset - small, understandable, and grouped by couisine

## üß© Key Features
- Image-based ingredient and tool detection using YOLOv8
