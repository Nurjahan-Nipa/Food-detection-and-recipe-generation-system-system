# CookVision: A Virtual AI-Powered Cooking Assistant for ingredient Detection and Recipe Gudiance Using Machine Learning

## üîç Abstract
**CookVision** is a virtual prototype of an AI-powered cooking assistant that uses machine learning and image detection to support the food preparation process. The system simulates a smart kitchen enviornment by using pre-recorded images and videos to detect ingredients, cooking tools, and food states. It integrates a pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv8) with a rule-based recipe recommendation engine to suggest context-aware recipts based on detected inputs.

The system is designed and tested entirely in a virtual space, enabling team members to develop and evaluate the core functionalities without physical hardware. A simple web-based interface displays detection results and guides users through recipe steps. This prototype serves as a foundation for future deployment on edge devices, demostrating the feasibility of combining computer vision and machine learning in the domain of intelligent cooking assistant.

## üß© Key Features
- Image-based ingredient and tool detection using YOLOv8
- Rule-based recipe suggestion engine
- Simulated video/image pipeline in place of physical sensors
- Lightweight web UI for interaction and visualization
- Modular architecture to allow team collaboration and extension

## üß™ Technology Used
- Python 3
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Streamlit or Flask (for UI)
- JSON / CSV (for recipe storage)
- Github & Notion (for collaboration)
- e.t.c.
